# Roam Research Issue Tracker

Hi there fellow Roamans!

We're experimenting with a GitHub based issue tracker to channel all the awesome detailed bug reports you all give us into a more permanent record.
Using GitHub issues will also make it easier for us to let you know when these issues are fixed, and in what release you can expect them.

You can see the list of existing issues by clicking [here](https://github.com/Roam-Research/issues/issues), or in the `Issues` tab above. Use the search box above the issue list to search and filter existing issues. Sometimes the issue you're looking for is already closed and there's an answer there you can use.

To report an issue click [here](https://github.com/Roam-Research/issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=), or press the `New issue` button in the issue list, and fill in the bug report template. We'll look at is as soon as we can. Please search if your issue already exists before opening a new one. 

You will need a GitHub account to submit issues, but making one is free and doesn't have any strings attached.

At the moment we're not using this issue tracker to gather feature requests though, so please keep it focused just on bugs!

You can also check out our [Help Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/1wnq-ZAAN), hang out with fellow Roamans on the [Roam Slack](https://roamresearch.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtODg3NjIzODEwNDgwLTdhMjczMGYwN2YyNmMzMDcyZjViZDk0MTA2M2UxOGM5NTMxNDVhNDE1YWVkNTFjMGM4OTE3MTQ3MjEzNzE1MTA), and tweet to the [Roam Twitter](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch).
