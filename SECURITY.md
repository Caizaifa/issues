## Security issues

To report security issues [click here](https://github.com/Roam-Research/issues/security/advisories/new) and fill the template to create a [Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories). These are separate from public issues in that only you and the Roam team can see them, which allows us to work on fixing the problem without publicizing it further for exploitation.
